# Project Questions
####      1. How can we program the computer to extract still frames from an video file?
####      2. What methods can be used to count and identify cells with consistent results?
####      3. What is the distance each cell has travelled from image to image and in total based on the data?
####      4. What is the velocity of each cell?
####      5. What user interface design would be the most effective to display the aforementioned information for a researcher?
####      6. What is the approximate surface area for each of identified cells?
      
# Project Goals:
- [x] Create a program to extract frames from a video file.
- [x] Conduct analysis and object recognition for each image by identifying the microglia cells.
- [x] Display cell count and image file name.
- [ ] Create a calibration routine to allow for user thresholding. (In Progress)
- [ ] Display approximate cell size (by pixel count) then find the center of each cell.
- [ ] Determine distance traveled by tracing the cell's path.
- [ ] Create a program that diplays data via a user interface.

# Objective 1: Create a program to extract frames from a video file (frameEx.py)

The program frameEx.py asks the user to provide the directory path to their file through the terminal command prompt. It then asks the user to specify a destination for the extracted files. There is error checking for both the file type and the directory to prevent potential overwriting of the data. 
The program then breaks the video into .jpg images and stores them in the specified directory. 
**(See Figure 1: Visualized Frame Extraction Program below)**

# Objective 2: Correctly Identify Cell Objects and Display The Cell Count. (counterCell-ver2.py)

## Tools:
- Spyder IDE: https://www.spyder-ide.org/
- Sci-Kit: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ (python module)
- Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/ (terminal environment for spyder installation)

# Program Operation:
- Requires string literal for the directory path to access the files generated by the frame extraction program. (Line 23 main.py)
- In the program definitions file, you may adjust the threshold values based on bit mask logic statement. (line 55, counterCell.py) 
- Click the play icon at the top of the spyder IDE just blow the run and debug tabs. This will run the cell count program on all .png files
  that were extracted from the video file that was processed by the frameEx program.
